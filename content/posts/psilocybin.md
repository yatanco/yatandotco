# Overview of how assisted therapy works

1. Pre-treatment preparation: Patients undergo an extensive screening process to determine their eligibility for psilocybin-assisted therapy. They receive preparatory sessions to educate them about the treatment, manage expectations, and establish rapport with the therapist.

2. Psilocybin administration: During the psilocybin session, patients are given a single dose of psilocybin in a controlled, supportive environment with trained therapists present. The dose is typically administered orally, either in capsules or mixed with a liquid. The patient is then instructed to lie down, wear eyeshades, and listen to music.

3. Therapeutic support: During the psilocybin session, patients receive supportive therapy from trained therapists to help them navigate any difficult emotions or experiences that may arise. Therapists use a non-directive approach, allowing patients to guide their own experience while providing emotional support and guidance as needed.

4. Integration: Following the psilocybin session, patients engage in a series of integration sessions to help them integrate the insights and experiences from the session into their daily life. Integration sessions may include reflection, journaling, and discussions with the therapist.
