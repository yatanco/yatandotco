Unfortunately my family has had a history of Alzheimer and dementia, my two grandmothers died of it and now it has affected my mother as well.
So I want to share a few resources to learn about Alzheimer and also to give some hope to those who are family or are care partners (formerly caregivers)

I personally follow Dr. Bredesen's logic of ReCODE protocol (Reversing Cognitive Decline) and all conventional neurologists say it can't harm, whilst functional neurologists say its the only way forward.
Studies are still small but promising.
